## Given an integer(+ve or -ve) consisting of at least one 5 in its digits(can have more than one 5). Return the maximum value by deleting exactly one 5 from its digit.

Ex:

N = 1598 => result = 198
(remove the only 5 from the sequence)

N = 150,958 => result = 15,098
(we wanna return the maximum value 15,098 > 10,958)

N = -5859 => result = -589 ( -589>- 859)

/// this is not a ful solution it will get get u number after removing first 5 from right
